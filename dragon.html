          <h1>Most advanced systems ever built</h1>
          <p> Crew Dragon (Demo-2) was the final major test for SpaceX´s human spaceflight system to be
          certified by NASA for operation crew missions to and from the International
          Space Station (ISS). SpaceX is returning human spaceflight with one of the
          safest, most advanced systems ever built, and NASA´s Commercial Crew Program
          is a turning point for America´s future in space exploration that lays
          the groundwork for future missions to the Moon, Mars and beyond.

          Crew Dragon was from the beginning designed to transport people, SpaceX’s Dragon
          spacecraft is capable of carrying both NASA astronauts and private
          passengers to destinations in low-Earth orbit, the Moon and beyond.
          The SpaceX Dragon 2/Crew Dragon is a class of reusable spacecraft developed
          and manufactured by American aerospace manufacturer, Space 
          Exploration Technologies Corp./SpaceX. As the successor to Dragon, a reusable
          cargo spacecraft. It has two variants: Crew Dragon, a space capsule capable of 
          ferrying up to seven astronaut, and Cargo Dragon, an updated replacement for the 
          original Dragon Spacecraft.

          <p>
            The Dragon spacecraft is capable of carrying up to seven passengers
            to and from Earth orbit, and beyond. It is the only spacecraft
            currently flying that is capable of returning significant amounts of
            cargo to Earth, and is the first private spacecraft to take humans
            to the space station. The pressurized section of the capsule is
            designed to carry both people and environmentally sensitive cargo.
            SpaceX Dragon spacecraft is capable of carrying up to 6,000/kgs/
            13,288 lbs of cargo to the station and returning 3,999kgs/6,614 lbs
            of cargo back to earth.
          </p>
          <p>
            The dragon is equipped with 16 Draco thrusters used to orient the
            spacecraft during the mission. Each Draco thruster is capable of
            generating 90 pounds of force in the vacuum of space.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Dragon spacecraft is equipped with two drogue parachutes to
            stabilize the Spacecraft following reentry and four main parachutes
            to further decelerate the spacecraft prior to landing.
