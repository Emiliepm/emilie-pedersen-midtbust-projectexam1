            <p>
              SpaceX also offers commercial flights for private passengers to both
              earth and Lunar orbit. You can experience Earth´s wonders from
              space. From the Himalayas and Giza´s Pyramids by day, to the glow of
              city lights, and the Aurora Borealis by night. Dragon fully orbits
              the earth every 90 minutes, making a highly customized flight path
              possible.

              Musk founded SpaceX with the goal of launching humans to Mars –
              something it hopes to achieve with its Starship vehicle it is
              currently working on, a new spacecraft designed to be the successor
              to Crew Dragon. SpaceX hopes to fly that vehicle to space with
              humans later this decade. But proving they can launch humans safely
              is a crucial first step in that journey. With today’s successful
              flight, Crew Dragon can begin a new exciting period of commercial
              spaceflight never seen before. The company also plans, however, to
              use Crew Dragon to launch paying customers into space. This could
              include space tourists hoping to visit the space station, or other
              destinations – such as orbiting space hotels – at a cost of $20
              million per seat.

              Already several such flights have been announced, with space for up
              to seven people on each. One rumored customer is Tom Cruise, who
              Bridenstine said earlier this year had contacted NASA about flying
              on Crew Dragon to the ISS and shooting a movie there. While Crew
              Dragon is limited to flying to low Earth orbit, SpaceX is hoping
              that its Starship vehicle – which will supposedly be able to carry
              more than 100 people on each flight – can reach more distant
              destinations. This may include the Moon and Mars. Already NASA has
              picked Starship, along with two other vehicles, as a potential way
              for the agency to reach the Moon in 2024 as part of their Artemis
              program. And Musk has made no secret of his desire to land humans on
              Mars. SpaceX aim at creating a market for commercial flights, 
              maybe you will be looking at 
              the Earth from space in the nearest future?
